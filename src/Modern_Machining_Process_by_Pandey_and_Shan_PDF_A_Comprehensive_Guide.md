In this article, we will review some of the main topics and concepts that are covered in the book Modern machining process by pandey and shan pdf. We will also provide some examples and applications of the modern machining processes that are discussed in the book.
 
## What are Modern Machining Processes?
 
Modern machining processes are unconventional machining methods that use physical or chemical phenomena to remove material from a workpiece. Unlike conventional machining methods, such as turning, milling, drilling, etc., which use mechanical forces and tools to cut or shape the material, modern machining processes use energy sources such as electricity, heat, light, sound, etc., to create controlled interactions between the tool and the workpiece. These interactions result in material removal by various mechanisms, such as melting, vaporization, erosion, chemical reaction, etc.
 
Modern machining processes have several advantages over conventional machining methods, such as:
 
- They can machine hard, brittle, or complex materials that are difficult or impossible to machine by conventional methods.
- They can produce intricate shapes and features with high accuracy and precision.
- They can reduce tool wear and damage, as there is no direct contact between the tool and the workpiece.
- They can improve the surface quality and finish of the machined parts.
- They can reduce the environmental impact and waste generation of the machining process.

However, modern machining processes also have some limitations and challenges, such as:

- They require high initial investment and operating costs for the equipment and energy sources.
- They may have low material removal rates and productivity compared to conventional methods.
- They may generate high temperatures and stresses that can affect the mechanical properties and integrity of the workpiece.
- They may require special safety measures and precautions to protect the operators and the environment from hazards such as radiation, noise, sparks, etc.

Therefore, modern machining processes should be selected and applied based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the workpiece material, the desired shape and quality of the machined part, and the economic and environmental factors of the machining process.
 
## What are some examples of Modern Machining Processes?
 
The book Modern machining process by pandey and shan pdf covers a wide range of modern machining processes that can be classified into three main categories: mechanical, electrochemical, and thermal processes. Here are some examples of each category:
 
### Mechanical Processes
 
Mechanical processes use mechanical energy to remove material from the workpiece by abrasion or erosion. The tool is usually a jet or beam of abrasive particles or fluid that impinges on the workpiece surface at high velocity. Some examples of mechanical processes are:

- Abrasive Jet Machining (AJM): A jet of high-pressure air or gas mixed with abrasive particles is used to cut or erode the workpiece material. AJM can machine hard or brittle materials such as ceramics, glass, metals, etc., with high accuracy and surface finish. AJM can also be used for cleaning, deburring, polishing, etching, etc.
- Water Jet Machining (WJM): A jet of high-pressure water is used to cut or erode the workpiece material. WJM can machine soft or ductile materials such as rubber, plastic, wood, etc., with low heat generation and minimal environmental impact. WJM can also be used for cleaning, washing, stripping, etc.
- Ultrasonic Machining (USM): A vibrating tool with abrasive particles attached to its tip is used to erode the workpiece material by hammering action. USM can machine hard or brittle materials such as ceramics, glass, carbides 0f148eb4a0
